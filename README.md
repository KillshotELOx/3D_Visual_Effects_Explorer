This is a 3D visual effects explorer built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js. It allows you to upload your own 3D models and apply various visual effects, such as cel shading and a jelly-like
distortion. The application features a user-friendly interface with a sidebar for selecting effects and a main view for interacting with the 3D model.

The project is powered by a Node.js and Express backend that communicates with the Google Generative AI API to dynamically generate descriptions for each visual effect. This provides an engaging and
informative experience as you explore the different visual transformations available.
